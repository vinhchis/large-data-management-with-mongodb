Let's break down how to combine data from different MongoDB collections in the Mongo shell.

**Understanding the Challenge**

MongoDB is designed for working with documents within individual collections.  There's no direct "JOIN" operation like in relational databases. However, you can achieve similar results using various strategies:

**1. Using `$lookup` (Most Efficient for Complex Joins)**

The `$lookup` aggregation stage is your go-to for performing joins. It lets you reference documents from another collection based on a matching field. Here's a breakdown:

```javascript
db.collection1.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "collection2", // The collection to join with
      localField: "field1", // Field in collection1 for matching
      foreignField: "field2", // Corresponding field in collection2
      as: "joined_data" // Alias for the joined results
    }
  },
  // Further processing (unwinding, etc.)
]);
```

**2. Using `$lookup` with Multiple Joins**

You can even chain multiple `$lookup` stages to perform more complex joins:

```javascript
db.collection1.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "collection2", 
      localField: "field1",
      foreignField: "field2",
      as: "joined_data1"
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "collection3",
      localField: "field3",
      foreignField: "field4",
      as: "joined_data2"
    }
  }
]);
```

**Example: Orders and Customers**

Let's say you have an "orders" collection and a "customers" collection. You want to retrieve orders along with the customer information for each order:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "customerId", 
      foreignField: "customerId", 
      as: "customer" 
    }
  },
  {
    $unwind: "$customer" // Flatten the customer array
  }
  // ... further processing if needed
]);
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Matching Fields:** The fields you use for `localField` and `foreignField` must have compatible data types.
* **Performance:** For large collections, `$lookup` can be more resource-intensive than alternative methods.
* **Unwinding:** If you want to access individual fields within joined documents, you'll likely need to use the `$unwind` operator to flatten the arrays created by `$lookup`.

**Alternatives:**

* **Client-Side Joins:** You can retrieve data from both collections separately and perform the join in your application code (e.g., Node.js, Python).
* **MapReduce:** While less common, MapReduce provides a flexible way to process data across multiple collections.
